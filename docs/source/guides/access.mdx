# Access ðŸ¤— Inference Endpoints

To access the [Inference Endpoints web application](https://ui.endpoints.huggingface.co/), you or your organization need to [add a valid payment method](https://huggingface.co/settings/billing) to your Hugging Face account.

<Tip>
  
You can check your <a href="https://huggingface.co/settings/billing">billing</a> if you're unsure whether you have an active payment method.
  
</Tip>

There are two pricing plans:

- Inference Endpoints pricing is based on your hourly compute, and billed monthly. This can be as low as $0.032 per CPU core/hr and $0.5 per GPU/hr depending on your needs. 
- There is also an [Enterprise](https://huggingface.co/support) plan for Inference Endpoints which offers dedicated support, 24/7 SLAs, and uptime guarantees. Pricing for Enterprise is custom and based on volume commit and annual contracts; [contact us](https://huggingface.co/inference-endpoints/dedicated/enterprise) for a quote if interested!

After you've added a valid payment method to your account, access the [Inference Endpoints web application](https://ui.endpoints.huggingface.co/) and start deploying! ðŸ¥³
