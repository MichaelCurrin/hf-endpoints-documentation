# Create an Endpoint

After your first login, you will be directed to the [Endpoint creation page](https://ui.endpoints.huggingface.co/new). As an example, this guide will go through the steps to deploy [distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english) for text classification. 

## 1. Enter the Hugging Face Repository ID and your desired endpoint name:

## 2. Select your Instance Configuration. Choose cloud provider, region, and instance type. If you're looking for a specific cloud provider, region, or instance that you don't yet see available, please let us know.

## 3. Apply Automatic Scale-to-Zero for your Endpoint or leave as is.

## 4. Define the [Security Level](security) for the Endpoint:

## 5. Feel free to customize your Endpoint further in Advanced Configuration: replica utoscaling, task, revision, framework, and container type are accessible in this section.

## 6. Create your Endpoint by clicking **Create Endpoint**. By default, your Endpoint is created with a medium CPU (2 x 4GB vCPUs with Intel Xeon Ice Lake). The cost estimate displayed is per hour and does not take autoscaling into account.

## 7. Wait for the Endpoint to build, initialize and run. Note that initializing time depends on the model size and typically takes between 1 to 5 minutes.

## 8. Test your Endpoint in the Overview with Playground üèÅ üéâ!
