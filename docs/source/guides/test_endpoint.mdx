# Send Requests to Endpoints

You can send requests to Inference Endpoints using the UI leveraging the Inference Widget or programmatically, e.g. with cURL or the `@huggingface/inference` library. Below you can find examples for each of these methods.

## Use the UI to send requests

The Endpoint overview provides access to the Inference Widget which can be used to send requests (see step 6 of [Create an Endpoint](/docs/inference-endpoints/guides/create_endpoint)). This allows you to quickly test your Endpoint with different inputs and share it with team members.

## Use cURL to send requests

The cURL command for the request above should look like this. You'll need to provide your user token which can be found in your Hugging Face [account settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens):

Example Request:

```bash
curl https://uu149rez6gw9ehej.eu-west-1.aws.endpoints.huggingface.cloud/distilbert-sentiment \
	-X POST \
	-d '{"inputs": "Deploying my first endpoint was an amazing experience."}' \
	-H "Authorization: Bearer <Token>"
```

The Endpoints API offers the same API definitions as the [Inference API](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/detailed_parameters) and the [SageMaker Inference Toolkit](https://huggingface.co/docs/sagemaker/reference#inference-toolkit-api). All the request payloads are documented in the [Supported Tasks](/docs/inference-endpoints/supported_tasks) section.

This means for an NLP task, the payload is represented as the `inputs` key and additional pipeline parameters are included in the `parameters` key. You can provide any of the supported `kwargs` from [pipelines](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines) as parameters.
For image or audio tasks, you should send the data as a binary request with the corresponding mime type. Below is an example cURL for an audio payload:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://uu149rez6gw9ehej.eu-west-1.aws.endpoints.huggingface.cloud/wav2vec-asr \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <Token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: audio/x-flac' \
  --data-binary '@sample1.flac'
```

To use your cURL command as code, use the [cURL Converter](https://curlconverter.com/) tool to quickly get started with the programming language of your choice.

## Use javascript library `@huggingface/inference`

You can use the javascript library to call an inference endpoint:

```ts
const inference = new HfInference('hf_...') // your user token

const gpt2 = inference.endpoint('https://xyz.eu-west-1.aws.endpoints.huggingface.cloud/gpt2-endpoint')
const { generated_text } = await gpt2.textGeneration({ inputs: 'The answer to the universe is' })
```

### Custom handler

`@huggingface/inference` supports tasks from https://huggingface.co/tasks, and is typed accordingly. 

If your model has additional inputs, or even custom inputs / outputs you can use the more generic `.request` / `streamingRequest`:

```ts
const output = await inference.request({
  inputs: "blablabla",
  parameters: {
    custom_parameter_1: ...,
    ...
  }
});
```
