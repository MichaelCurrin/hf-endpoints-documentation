# Update your Endpoint

You can update `running` endpoints, to change the autoscaling configuration and instance size.
If your endpoint is in the `failed` state you would have to currently create a new endpoint.

_We are working on adding support for revision and task as well._ 

## Update instance size 

You can update the instance size of your endpoint on the endpoint overview menu. You can change the instance size of your instance type. 
This means you can increase or decrease the same instance type, e.g. `CPU` but not yet upgrade from CPU to GPU.

## Update autoscaling

You can update the autoscaling configuration of your endpoint on the endpoint overview menu. You can change the minimum and maximum number of replicas.
