# Security & Compliance

ðŸ¤— Inference Endpoints is built with security and secure inference at its core. We currently offer three types of endpoints, in order or increasing security level:

* **Public**: A Public Endpoint is available from the internet, secured with TLS/SSL, and requires no authentication.
* **Protected**: A Protected Endpoint is available from the internet, secured with TLS/SSL, and requires a valid Hugging Face token for authentication.
* **Private** A Private Endpoint is only available through an intra-region secured AWS or Azure PrivateLink connection. Private Endpoints are not accessible from the internet.

Public and Protected Endpoints do not require any additional configuration. For Private Endpoints, you need to provide the AWS account ID of the account which also should have access to ðŸ¤— Inference Endpoints.
